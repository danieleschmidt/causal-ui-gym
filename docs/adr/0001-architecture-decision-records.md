# ADR-0001: Architecture Decision Records

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need a systematic way to document architectural decisions and their rationale for the Causal UI Gym project.

## Decision
We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to capture important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences.

## Consequences
- All architectural decisions will be documented and version controlled
- Team members can understand the reasoning behind design choices
- Future changes can reference historical decisions
- Knowledge is preserved for new team members
