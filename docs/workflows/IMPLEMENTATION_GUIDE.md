# CI/CD Implementation Guide

This repository is ready for advanced CI/CD automation. The following workflows should be implemented in `.github/workflows/`:

## Required Workflows

### 1. Main CI/CD Pipeline (`ci-cd.yml`)
```yaml
# Comprehensive CI/CD with matrix testing, security scanning, and deployment
# - Multi-environment testing (Node 18, 20, Python 3.9-3.12)
# - Parallel execution of TypeScript and Python test suites
# - Dependency vulnerability scanning
# - Container security scanning
# - Automated SBOM generation
# - Conditional deployment to staging/production
```

### 2. Security Scanning (`security.yml`)
```yaml
# Advanced security automation
# - CodeQL analysis for TypeScript and Python
# - Container scanning with Trivy
# - Dependency scanning with Snyk
# - Secret scanning validation
# - SLSA provenance generation
```

### 3. Performance Testing (`performance.yml`)
```yaml
# Performance regression detection
# - Frontend bundle size analysis
# - Lighthouse CI for React components
# - JAX backend performance benchmarks
# - Memory usage profiling
# - Performance regression alerts
```

### 4. Release Automation (`release.yml`)
```yaml
# Automated releases and changelog generation
# - Semantic versioning based on conventional commits
# - Automated changelog generation
# - GitHub release creation
# - NPM/PyPI package publishing
# - Container registry publishing
```

## Implementation Status

- [ ] **MANUAL ACTION REQUIRED**: Create `.github/workflows/` directory
- [ ] **MANUAL ACTION REQUIRED**: Implement the 4 core workflows above
- [ ] **MANUAL ACTION REQUIRED**: Configure repository secrets for deployments
- [ ] **MANUAL ACTION REQUIRED**: Set up branch protection rules

## Integration Points

All pre-commit hooks, testing, and security tools are already configured and ready for CI/CD integration.

## Monitoring and Alerting

See `/docs/MONITORING.md` for observability setup that integrates with these workflows.
