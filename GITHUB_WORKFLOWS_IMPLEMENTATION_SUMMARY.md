# GitHub Actions Workflows Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the complete implementation of GitHub Actions workflows for the Causal UI Gym repository. All workflows have been created and validated locally but require manual setup due to GitHub App permission limitations.

## üö® Manual Setup Required

Due to GitHub App permissions, the workflow files cannot be automatically pushed to the repository. **Repository maintainers must manually copy these files to complete the SDLC implementation.**

### Required Action
```bash
# Copy the workflow files from this branch to the main branch
git checkout main
git checkout terragon/implement-sdlc-checkpoints-p3k9yq -- .github/workflows/
git checkout terragon/implement-sdlc-checkpoints-p3k9yq -- .github/dependabot.yml
git add .github/
git commit -m "feat: add comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows"
git push origin main
```
