   - Configure repository secrets for deployments

2. **Monitoring Setup**:
   - Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.monitoring.yml up -d`
   - Configure Grafana dashboards
   - Set up alerting endpoints

3. **Security Integration**:
   - Configure Cosign for artifact signing
   - Set up SLSA provenance generation
   - Enable vulnerability scanning in CI/CD

### Development Actions (Medium Priority)
1. **Dependencies Installation**:
   ```bash
   npm install @stryker-mutator/core @stryker-mutator/vitest-runner
   npm install @pact-foundation/pact lighthouse
   pip install bandit safety semgrep
   ```

2. **IDE Setup**:
   - Install recommended VS Code extensions
   - Configure debugging environments
   - Set up performance profiling
