# Project Charter: Causal UI Gym

## Executive Summary

**Causal UI Gym** is a React + JAX framework that revolutionizes how we test and improve Large Language Model (LLM) causal reasoning capabilities through interactive user interface experiments. By bridging the gap between academic causal inference research and practical UI testing, this project addresses the critical challenge identified in Stanford's CausaLM research: LLMs demonstrate weak causal modeling abilities that impact real-world decision-making systems.

---

## üéØ Project Scope

### Problem Statement
Current LLM evaluation methods for causal reasoning are primarily text-based and fail to capture the complexity of real-world decision scenarios where users interact with visual interfaces. This creates a significant gap between research findings and practical applications, particularly in:
- Business intelligence dashboards
- Healthcare decision support systems  
- Financial modeling interfaces
- Policy simulation tools

### Solution Approach
Causal UI Gym provides a comprehensive framework that:
1. **Converts Figma designs** into causal reasoning experiments
2. **Enables real-time testing** of LLM causal understanding through UI interactions
3. **Leverages JAX** for high-performance causal computations
4. **Provides standardized metrics** for comparing LLM causal reasoning abilities
5. **Offers reusable components** for building custom causal experiments
