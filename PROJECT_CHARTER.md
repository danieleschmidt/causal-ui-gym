# Project Charter: Causal UI Gym

## Executive Summary

Causal UI Gym is a research framework designed to evaluate and improve Large Language Model (LLM) causal reasoning capabilities through interactive, visual user interfaces. The project bridges the gap between academic causal inference research and practical LLM evaluation by providing a comprehensive testing environment built on React + JAX technologies.

## Problem Statement

### Research Challenge
Recent studies, including Stanford's CausaLM research, have identified significant weaknesses in LLM causal reasoning abilities. Current evaluation methods are primarily text-based and fail to capture the nuanced understanding required for real-world causal inference tasks.

### Technical Gap
- **Limited Visual Testing**: Existing causal inference tools focus on algorithmic implementation rather than user interaction testing
- **Fragmented Evaluation**: No unified framework for comparing LLM causal reasoning across different providers
- **Design-to-Research Barrier**: Researchers cannot easily convert conceptual designs into interactive experiments

## Project Scope

### In Scope
1. **Core Causal Engine**: JAX-based do-calculus computation with GPU acceleration
2. **Interactive UI Framework**: React components for causal graph manipulation and intervention
3. **Multi-LLM Integration**: Support for OpenAI, Anthropic, and extensible agent framework
4. **Figma Plugin**: Design-to-experiment workflow for rapid prototyping
5. **Metrics Framework**: Real-time causal reasoning accuracy measurement (ATE, backdoor identification)
6. **Experiment Templates**: Pre-built scenarios for economics, medical diagnosis, and other domains

### Out of Scope
- Production-scale causal inference for business applications
- Full statistical modeling framework (use existing libraries like DoWhy)
- LLM training or fine-tuning capabilities
- Complex multi-modal input processing

## Success Criteria

### Technical Objectives
- [ ] **Performance**: Sub-100ms intervention computation for graphs <50 nodes
